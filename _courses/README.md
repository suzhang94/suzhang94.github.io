Make a new file in this directory for each course you're teaching or thought previously.

Put the following front matter at the beginning of your file:

```
---
title: "CMPUT 6xx: COURSE TITLE"
semester: Fall 202x
institute: University of Alberta
---
```

File name could be anything you like, and it's used to create the permalink for course page;
unless you explicitly set `permalink` in the front matter.
