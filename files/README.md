Put any files here (pdf, zip, etc.) and reference them in your posts/pages as follows:

```
{{ '/files/EXAMPLE.zip' | relative_url }}
```

For example, if you want to create a hyperlink to `EXAMPLE.zip`, use the following code in your Markdown file

```
Download [EXAMPLE.zip]({{ '/files/EXAMPLE.zip' | relative_url }})
```
